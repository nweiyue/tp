## Project: Addendum for Teaching Assistants (ATAS)

ATAS is a desktop class management application used for improving the efficiency when managing sessions of a class. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added session and session list related features, including presence and participate.
  * What it does: allows the user add sessions to the session list, toggle presence and participation status of student, then saving relavent data locally.
  * Justification: This feature is the main purpose of this app, which allows users to record down key information.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.

* **New Feature**: Added student and session presence/participation statistics.
  * What it does: calculates the statistics (i.e. percentage of presence and participation) of students in every session and statistics of each invidual student in the class.
  * Justification: This feature make it easier to obtain statistical data since thing are calculated automatically.
